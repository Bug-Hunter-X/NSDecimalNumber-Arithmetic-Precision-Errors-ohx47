The solution involves careful consideration of the scale and precision of the `NSDecimalNumber` objects involved in the calculations.  Instead of relying solely on addition or subtraction directly, we utilize the `decimalNumberByAdding:`, `decimalNumberBySubtracting:`, `decimalNumberByMultiplyingBy:`, and `decimalNumberByDividingBy:` methods which allow for more explicit control over the resulting precision.  Alternatively, one could use `NSDecimal` directly with functions from `NSDecimalNumber`'s underlying functionality for better control.  The code would be modified as follows:  

```objectivec
// Instead of:
// result = largeNumber + smallNumber;

// Use:
NSDecimalNumber *result = [largeNumber decimalNumberByAdding:smallNumber];

// Explicitly check for the change:
NSDecimalNumber *expectedResult = [largeNumber decimalNumberByAdding:smallNumber withBehavior:roundingBehavior]; // Use an appropriate NSDecimalNumberHandler for rounding.
if (![result isEqualToNumber:expectedResult]) {
    // Handle the precision error, perhaps by logging a warning or using a different strategy
}

```

This approach ensures that the results of arithmetic operations on `NSDecimalNumber` objects are handled with greater care and accuracy, minimizing the risk of precision-related errors.
